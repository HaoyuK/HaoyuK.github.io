I am Haoyu Kuang (旷皓予), a first year master student at Fudan University in the School of Data Science, Shanghai, China. I'm currently advised by Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.fudan-disc.com/people/zywei) and carrying out my research at the [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab (Fudan DISC)](http://www.fudan-disc.com/).

### Research Interests

My interested research topics are mostly around computational social science and graph representation learning, including:
- Computational Social Science via Large Vision Language Model
- Agents Simulation powered by Large Language Model
- Text-Attributed Graph Pre-training
